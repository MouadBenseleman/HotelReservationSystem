1- No, putting all the functions inside a single service is not a recommended approach.

Each entity should have its own service in order to respect the separation of concerns principle.
This helps keep the code clean, organized, and easier to maintain, especially as the application grows.
In addition, it is often useful to introduce a shared business or rule layer that contains common logic used
by multiple services.This avoids code duplication, reduces complexity, and improves maintainability.

This design fits well with a 4-tier architecture, where each layer has a clear responsibility:

* Presentation Layer: Controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses
* Business Logic Layer: Services that contain application rules
* Data Access Layer: Repositories or Hibernate for database operations
* Database Layer: The database itself

2-Another way to handle this is to avoid modifying an existing room at all. Instead of updating the room
when setRoom(..) is called, we can create a new room object and keep the old one unchanged.
This way, previous bookings still refer to the old room data, and nothing breaks.
So my recommandation is to add a condition to the function setRoom(..)  when the room is already booked the backend will send an Exception .
